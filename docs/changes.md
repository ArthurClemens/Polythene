### 1.0.0

Equal to rc.11.


<a id="pre-releases"></a>
## Pre releases


#### 1.0.0-rc.11

Changes to components:

* Toolbar: Added support for action links. Use class `pe-action`.


#### 1.0.0-rc.10

Removed `polythene-fastclick` as it is no longer needed - the tap response on mobile is now sufficiently fast.

Changes to components:

* Button: the default side margin has been removed
  * Add parent element with class `.pe-button-row` to re-add the margins, or add margins where needed
* List:
  * Removed keyboard control in favor of (more flexible) example code; see:
    * Mithril
      * [List](components/mithril/list.md#keyboard-control)
      * [Search](components/mithril/search.md#result-list)
    * React
      * [List](components/react/list.md#keyboard-control)
      * [Search](components/react/search.md#result-list)
  * Option `padding` has new possible values "top", "bottom", "none" and "both", replacing `false`
* TextField and Search: option `focus` has been removed (because setting the focus state outside of an event does not work on iOS)
  * Use the `onChange` callback that returns the function `setInputState` - see [documentation for Mithril](components/mithril/textfield.md#programmatically-setting-focus-and-value), [documentation for React](components/react/textfield.md#programmatically-setting-focus-and-value)

Bug fixes.



#### 1.0.0-rc.9

To make component packages more standalone, CSS classes are no longer exported by the component but from the common module `polythene-css-classes`:

~~~javascript
import buttonClasses from "polythene-css-classes/button"
~~~

All references to React 15 have been replaced with React 16.

Changes to components:

* Toolbar now has a default background color

Bug fixes (thanks sjungwirth and ItsLeeOwen!).

Updated for React 16.

Changes to components:

#### 1.0.0-rc.7

Fix for newly introduced bug in button onclick handling.



#### 1.0.0-rc.6

* CSS can now optionally be read from files (as opposed to CSS-in-JS only); see [CSS](css.md) for more details.
* `addLayoutStyles` and `addTypography` are now both imported from `polythene-css`; see [CSS](css.md).

Changes to components:

* All
  * As consequence of the CSS change, the component method `theme` has been replaced with `addStyle`; see [Theming Configuration variables](theming/configuration-variables.md)
* RadioGroup
  * `onChange` now returns a state object that contains a variable `value`
